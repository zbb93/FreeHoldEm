# FreeHoldEm
Texas Hold Em game in Java. Currently text based and runs in the terminal. Eventually I would like to have a GUI for the 
game. The AI implementation is currently quite rudimentary, but I am hoping to make some improvements to it soon.

To run the game simply clone the repo and compile all the files with 'javac *.java'
and run the FreeHoldEm.java file with 'java FreeHoldEm'

This is my largest project to date and also my first time making a game so I am very much interested in any feedback you may have to offer.
