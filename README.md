# FreeHoldEm
Texas Hold Em game in Java. Currently text based and runs in the terminal. Eventually I would like to have a GUI for the 
game. The AI implementation is currently quite rudimentary, but I am hoping to make some improvements to it soon.

# Build Instructions
To run the game simply clone the repo and compile all the files with:<br>
<code>mvn clean compile</code><br>
and run the game with:<br>
<code>mvn exec:java</code><br>
